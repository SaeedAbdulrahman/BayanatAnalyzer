# BayanatAnalyzer
A python script that uses data analysis and machine learning in order to further understand or predict incidents in the future.

## Idea:
This script would get datasets from bayanat.ae and group it or sort it in a way that would utilize it to grasp a better understanding of incidents. It will be processed by machine learning algorithms from which it could predict future incidents by relating it to certain factors.

## Implementation:
This project is currently under development.
The libraries that I am using:
- Pandas (for Data Analytics)
- Numpy (for Data Science and Machine Learning)
- Matplotlib (Visualization Library)
- scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
